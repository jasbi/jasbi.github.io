At what age do children understand and produce logical connectives like <i>and</i>, <i>or</i>, <i>if</i>, and <i>not</i>? <br>3.

It is easy to show that your question will help us learn no matter what. Your question is either:<br> (1) not framed well; in which case you give us a chance to explain the topic better. Chances are we did not explain it well the first time and many of your classmates are wondering about it too. <br> (2) framed well and has an answer we know; in which case we can help you as well as your classmates who have the same question learn it too! You have also helped us consolidate our knowledge by explaining it again. <br> (3) framed well but has an answer we do not know; in which case we can find the answer together and your question has helped all of us learn! <br> (4) framed well and does not have an answer yet; in which case you found a research topic someone can start working on and benefit the field! <br> As you see, your question has helped our learning either way. So please ask! Please wonder! <br> <br> Sometimes instructors or students worry that asking too many questions may halt class progress. Judging when to ask a question is tricky but also part of what we need to learn. <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Ask-Questions-in-Class">This is a useful wikihow article that starts with some obvious tips but ends with really good ones!</a> Ultimately, we trust you to decide whether asking a question is halting the class progress or not.
