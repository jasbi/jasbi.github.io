At a larger scale and within a scientific community, it is also a major contributor to scientific progress. Therefore, sharing your thoughts and questions can help us learn and build a wider, stronger community of scholars. <br> <br> Some of you may worry that your classmate's asking questions and sharing ideas may disrupt the class progress. Judging when to ask a question or share an idea is tricky but also part of your education. Instead of discouraging it, we would like to practice it together. Here is flowchart that you might find useful. Ultimately, we trust your judgments. <br>

Chances are we did not explain it well the first time and many of your classmates are wondering about it too. <br> (2) framed well and has an answer we know; in which case we can help you as well as your classmates who have the same question learn it too! You have also helped us consolidate our knowledge by explaining it again. <br> (3) framed well but has an answer we do not know; in which case we can find the answer together and your question has helped all of us learn! <br> (4) framed well and does not have an answer yet; in which case you found a research topic someone can start working on and benefit the field! <br> As you see, your question has helped our learning either way.
