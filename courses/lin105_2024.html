You should also mention whether authors have had roughly equal contribution in your judgment and the grade should be distributed equally or not. Common examples of unequal contribution are members missing meetings and work sessions of the group frequently or being completely absent and unresponsive until deadlines or even after.

Your background, life experiences, knowledge, thoughts, and ideas make you unique, and our classroom diverse. This diversity of perspectives is the foundation of learning in a classroom. At a larger scale and within a scientific community, it is also a major contributor to scientific progress. Therefore, sharing your thoughts and questions can help us learn and build a wider, stronger community of scholars. <br> <br> Some of you may worry that your classmate's asking questions and sharing ideas may disrupt the class progress. Judging when to ask a question or share an idea is tricky but also part of education. Instead of discouraging it, we would like to practice it together. Here is flowchart that you might find useful. Ultimately, we trust your judgments. <br>

The point of going to a class is to learn together and questions are our best tool to achieve that. It is easy to show that your question will help us learn no matter what. Your question is either:<br> (1) not framed well; in which case you give us a chance to explain the topic better. Chances are we did not explain it well the first time and many of your classmates are wondering about it too. <br> (2) framed well and has an answer we know; in which case we can help you as well as your classmates who have the same question learn it too! You have also helped us consolidate our knowledge by explaining it again. <br> (3) framed well but has an answer we do not know; in which case we can find the answer together and your question has helped all of us learn! <br> (4) framed well and does not have an answer yet; in which case you found a research topic someone can start working on and benefit the field! <br> As you see, your question has helped our learning either way. So please ask!
